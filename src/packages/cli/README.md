# Agentgenesis-CLI

A CLI (inspired by shadcn-ui) for adding agentgenesis components to your project, making it easier to integrate and manage AI components within your codebase.

## Installation

To get started with the `Agentgenesis-CLI` CLI, ensure you have `npx` installed. This tool allows you to run packages directly from npm without globally installing them.

### Adding Components

Use the `add` command to add components to your project. This command installs the required dependencies and integrates the specified component into your project.

1. **Add a Specific Component**

   To add a specific component, specify the component name:

   ```bash
    npx agentgenesis add [component]
   ```

   **Example:**

   Adding the `LinkedIn Tool`:

   ```bash
    npx agentgenesis add linkedintool
   ```
